# What is this?
A python-based application that plays Bookworm Adventures.

It works by reading the screen and parsing the available letters based on the grid.

Then it will compute a list of possible words using the available letters, and will proceed to type out the words.

PyLex is compatible with both Volume 1 and Volume 2.

This uses libraries such as [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) for locating letters and inputting words, and [PyWin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/) for locating the game window and fetching its position.
